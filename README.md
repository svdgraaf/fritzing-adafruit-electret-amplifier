# Fritzing part for the Adafruit Electret Microphone Amplifier
I needed this part for a board I was developing, and couldn't find the part, so here we are.
The part is the [Electret Microphone Amplifier](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1713). Do note that the PCB silkscreen doesn't have rounded corners. A PR is always welcome :)

1. Download the part as [zipfile](https://github.com/svdgraaf/fritzing-rfm9xw/archive/master.zip)
